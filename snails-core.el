;;; Commentary:
;;
;; A modern, easy-to-expand fuzzy search framework
;;

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put snails.el to your load-path.
;; The load-path is usually ~/elisp/.
;; It's set in your ~/.emacs like this:
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;;
;; If you are using Mac, install exec-path-from-shell from https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell.
;;
;; And the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'snails)
;;
;; No need more.

;;; Customize:
;;
;;
;;
;; All of the above can customize by:
;;      M-x customize-group RET snails RET
;;

;;; Change log:
;;
;; 2020/03/30
;;      * Add `snails-focus-init-frame' fix Mac focus problem.
;;
;; 2020/03/28
;;      * Remap `hl-line' color with `snails-input-buffer-face', avoid two colors in input backgorund.
;;
;; 2020/03/21
;;      * Make snails follow Emacs theme.
;;
;; 2020/02/27
;;      * Don't delete snails frame to improve performance.
;;      * Use `with-selected-frame' make sure command execute in root frame.
;;
;; 2020/01/20
;;      * Add search prefix tips under input buffer.
;;
;; 2019/12/05
;;      * Within two seconds of the call only once snails function, to avoid problems start blinking twice interface under KDE environment.
;;
;; 2019/09/01
;;      * We need init `snails-candiate-list' with `snails-backends', otherwise first launch will fail.
;;
;; 2019/08/27
;;      * Make `snails' function support customize search string.
;;      * Fix search-object condition order.
;;      * Add new options `snails-default-backends' and `snails-prefix-backends'.
;;      * Fix issue #29
;;
;; 2019/08/25
;;      * Support search content with input prefix.
;;
;; 2019/08/20
;;      * Call `snails-init-face-with-theme' when user execute snails command.
;;
;; 2019/08/08
;;      * Run snails-mode-hook in `snails-create-input-buffer', evil users should be hook evil code after `snails-mode-hook'.
;;
;; 2019/07/29
;;      * Make `snails-mode-hook' works, sorry i forgot add `run-hooks'.
;;
;; 2019/07/28
;;      * Optimize performance: fixed rendering every 100 milliseconds, instead of rendering once backend return candidates, avoiding rendering computation waste.
;;      * `snails-select-line-number' is not need anymore, `snails-select-line-overlay' is enough.
;;      * Add `snails-render-bufer' to timer when first start.
;;      * Keep offset of selected candidate.
;;      * Optimize start performance: delay 50 milliseconds to start search backend.
;;
;; 2019/07/26
;;      * Foucs out to hide snails frame on Mac.
;;      * Snails will search symbol around point when you press prefix key before call snails.
;;      * Make async process buffer's name starts with " *" to hide process buffer tab when search.
;;      * Make `snails' support backends and search-object arguments.
;;      * Add new command `snails-search-point'.
;;      * Add `snails-flash-line'.
;;      * Improve `snails-sort-candidates'
;;      * Add option `snails-fame-width-proportion' and `snails-fame-height-proportion'.
;;
;; 2019/07/25
;;      * Set undecorated parameter in `make-frame' function.
;;      * Try to raise snails frame when focus default frame by alt + tab switcher of OS.
;;      * Quit snails when lost input focus.
;;      * Support ansi color from asynchronous backend process.
;;      * Adjust ansi color code.
;;
;; 2019/07/24
;;      * Don't ask user when snails kill buffer of backend process.
;;      * Test GUI environment when start snails.
;;      * Don't wrap long line in content buffer.
;;      * Call `exec-path-from-shell' at snails-core.el
;;      * Use fuzz match algorithm provide by `fuz' libary.
;;
;; 2019/07/23
;;      * Kill old subprocess immediately, don't wait `run-with-idle-timer'
;;      * Split input window with on line height.
;;      * Make color along with current theme.
;;      * Quit snails if it has opened.
;;      * Add device to disable window configuration change snail frame.
;;      * Exit snails when enter to minibuffer.
;;      * Add new command `snails-candidate-copy'
;;      * Add parent-frame parameter, then snails frame won't hide when switch to other application.
;;
;; 2019/07/22
;;      * Delete other window first, make sure only one window in frame.
;;      * Finish `snails-select-next-backend' and `snails-select-prev-backend'
;;      * Use setq in macro, we can update backend code later.
;;      * Make `snails' support customize backend.
;;      * Fixed error that `set-buffer' on killed buffer.
;;      * Use `expand-file-name' expand default-directory, fd don't like unexpand directory.
;;      * Fix selected delete buffer error when call `buffer-string' in `snails-create-async-process'
;;      * Give up creating subprocess if input ticker already expired.
;;      * Kill all subprocess and process buffers when call `snails-quit'
;;      * Fix bug that select previous candidate item will select header line sometimes.
;;      * Add header index after header line.
;;      * Use `run-with-idle-timer' instead `run-with-timer' to improve performance of subprocess search.
;;      * 0.1 second is enough for `run-with-idle-timer'.
;;      * Fix `string-join' depend.
;;      * Disable scrollbar and fringle in new frame even user not disable them in theme.
;;
;; 2019/07/20
